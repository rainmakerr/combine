Yet another attempt to reproduce results from [neural art paper](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.06576v1.pdf) by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker and Matthias Bethge with Python and Caffe.

If you have installed dependencies for deepdream, you should be able to run this code as well. Otherwise, you need to install Caffe, and it should provide all dependencies (see the guide [here](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)). [Docker container](http://ryankennedy.io/running-the-deep-dream/) might be a better option if you don't want to spend much time installing dependencies.
